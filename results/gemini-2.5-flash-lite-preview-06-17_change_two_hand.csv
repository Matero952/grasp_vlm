The blade extends horizontally from the body of the chainsaw.For effective use, the left hand should grasp the front handle for stability and steering, and the right hand should grasp the rear handle and trigger assembly for control and operation.Left hand placement: The front handle is curved and located on the upper left side of the chainsaw body.Right hand placement: The rear handle is integrated with the motor housing and the trigger is located below it.Let's define the bounding boxes based on these observations.Left hand: The front handle is the black curved part on the top left.Right hand: The rear handle and trigger area is the black part on the top right with the trigger mechanism visible.Bounding box for left hand: I'll focus on the curved handle on the top left.y_min: 138x_min: 422y_max: 438x_max: 588Bounding box for right hand: I'll focus on the rear handle and trigger area on the top right.y_min: 132x_min: 452y_max: 575x_max: 575Let me re-evaluate. The image shows a hedge trimmer, not a chainsaw. The cutting bar is thin and long, characteristic of a hedge trimmer. My previous analysis was based on a chainsaw assumption. I need to re-evaluate based on the tool being a hedge trimmer.For a hedge trimmer, one hand typically operates the trigger and controls, while the other hand grips the secondary handle for stability and guidance.Left hand (secondary handle): This would be the front handle, which is a black curved bar.Right hand (primary handle/trigger): This would be the rear handle integrated with the motor and the trigger.Let's refine the bounding boxes for a hedge trimmer.Left hand placement (front handle):y_min: 139x_min: 417y_max: 443x_max: 588Right hand placement (rear handle/trigger):y_min: 133x_min: 448y_max: 577x_max: 577Looking closer at the image, the item is definitely a hedge trimmer. The long blade is a giveaway.The left hand would grasp the front handle, and the right hand would grasp the rear handle and trigger.Left hand: The front curved handle.y_min: 140x_min: 418y_max: 444x_max: 588Right hand: The rear handle and trigger assembly.y_min: 134x_min: 450y_max: 578x_max: 578Let me double check the coordinates and proportions.The left hand grasping the front handle.y_min: 140, x_min: 418, y_max: 444, x_max: 588. This box seems to encompass the entire front handle well.The right hand grasping the rear handle and trigger.y_min: 134, x_min: 450, y_max: 578, x_max: 578. This box covers the motor housing and the trigger area.The tool is lying on the ground, so the orientation is as shown. The left hand would naturally go on the front handle for directional control, and the right hand on the rear handle to operate the motor and trigger.Final check on the regions.Left hand: [140, 418, 444, 588] - This covers the front handle.Right hand: [134, 450, 578, 578] - This covers the rear handle and trigger area.It appears my initial assessment of the object as a chainsaw was incorrect, but the principle of hand placement on the handles remains similar for both tools. I will proceed with the bounding boxes for the hedge trimmer as identified.Rechecking the boundaries based on the provided image and crops.Left hand (front handle): The curved part. Roughly from y=140 to y=440, and x=420 to x=590.Right hand (rear handle and trigger): The main body with the trigger. Roughly from y=130 to y=580, and x=450 to x=580.Adjusting coordinates slightly for better fit.Left hand:y_min: 138x_min: 416y_max: 446x_max: 590Right hand:y_min: 132x_min: 448y_max: 579x_max: 579These coordinates seem reasonable for grasping the handles of the hedge trimmer.The goal is to cut firewood, which is usually done with a chainsaw. However, the image clearly shows a hedge trimmer. The prompt asks me to analyze the image of the chainsaw and identify placements for using it to cut firewood. This is a contradiction. I should address the object in the image, which is a hedge trimmer. If the prompt *insists* on it being a chainsaw, then the premise is flawed. However, the instruction is to ""analyze the provided image of the chainsaw"". I will proceed with the assumption that the user *meant* to provide a chainsaw image or expects me to treat this hedge trimmer as if it were a chainsaw for the purpose of identifying hand placements. Given the direct instruction to analyze ""the chainsaw"", I will proceed as if it is one and locate the handles. The hand placements on a hedge trimmer are functionally similar to a chainsaw for basic operation.The front handle for the left hand.The rear handle and trigger for the right hand.Coordinates:Left hand: y_min: 138, x_min: 416, y_max: 446, x_max: 590Right hand: y_min: 132, x_min: 448, y_max: 579, x_max: 579These are the best fits for the primary and secondary handles of the tool shown.```json{""hand1"" : [138, 416, 446, 590], ""hand2"" : [132, 448, 579, 579]}```";{'hand1': [0.448, 0.132, 0.579, 0.579], 'hand2': [0.416, 0.138, 0.59, 0.446]};{'hand1': {'x_1': 0.118, 'y_1': 0.35, 'x_2': 0.2605, 'y_2': 0.406}, 'hand2': {'x_1': 0.372, 'y_1': 0.137, 'x_2': 0.49, 'y_2': 0.4225}};{'hand1': 0.0, 'hand2': 0.31788669444947765};435;1531
1;grasp_vlm_dataset/lever_handle15_jpg.rf.c150ac0d0348314fde586b1ad6710920.jpg;The image shows a door with a horizontal lever handle. The handle is located in the middle of the door, with four horizontal slats above and below it. The handle itself is a silver, T-shaped lever. To grasp the handle, the robot's hand should be placed around it. The most effective way to do this would be to cover the entire handle and a small portion of the door around it. Based on the image, a suitable bounding box for the hand to grasp the handle would encompass the handle and some of the surrounding wood grain texture. The handle is roughly centered horizontally on the door and is located between the second and third horizontal slats. The bounding box should be large enough to encompass the entire T-shape of the handle. A good estimation for the bounding box would be: y_min: This should be slightly above the top of the T-bar. x_min: This should be slightly to the left of the vertical part of the T-bar. y_max: This should be slightly below the bottom of the T-bar. x_max: This should be slightly to the right of the T-bar. Looking at the image and estimating the proportions: The handle appears to start around 53% down the door's height and end around 62% down. Horizontally, the handle appears to be centered around 31% of the door's width. Therefore, I will select a bounding box that covers the entire handle. y_min: 530 x_min: 270 y_max: 620 x_max: 350 This bounding box will allow the robot's hand to securely grasp the horizontal lever door handle. ```json {hand: [530, 270, 620, 350]} ```;{'hand': [0.27, 0.53, 0.35, 0.62]};{'handle': {'x_1': 0.296, 'y_1': 0.552, 'x_2': 0.364, 'y_2': 0.5645}};{'hand': 0.09152542372881331};446;395
2;grasp_vlm_dataset/bolt_cutters6_cleanup_jpeg.rf.139814175d5ad6aa1a18ff6983dd6ec0.jpg;"The goal is to cut a padlock with bolt cutters. To do this, the robotic hands need to grasp the handles of the bolt cutters in a way that allows for maximum leverage and control. The image shows a pair of blue bolt cutters with black grips on the handles. The bolt cutters are positioned with the jaws open, ready for use.1. **Identify the handles:** The handles are the long, blue parts of the bolt cutters that extend from the pivot point. They have black rubber grips at the ends.2. **Determine optimal grasp points:** For effective use of bolt cutters, the hands should grip the handles as far down as possible, towards the ends, to maximize leverage. The grips are designed for this purpose.3. **Select hand placement:**    * **Hand 1 (Left hand):** Should grasp the left handle, near its end.    * **Hand 2 (Right hand):** Should grasp the right handle, near its end.4. **Define bounding boxes:** Based on the image, the bounding boxes for the handles are:    * **Left handle:** The left handle is the one on the left side of the image. Its bounding box should encompass the blue handle and the black grip.    * **Right handle:** The right handle is the one on the right side of the image. Its bounding box should encompass the blue handle and the black grip.5. **Estimate normalized coordinates:**    * **Left handle:** Looking at the image, the left handle's black grip is roughly from y=70 to y=210 and x=360 to x=470. The blue part of the handle below it extends further down. A good grasp would cover a significant portion of the handle for leverage. So, a reasonable bounding box for the left hand would be approximately [70, 350, 500, 480].    * **Right handle:** Similarly, the right handle's black grip is roughly from y=150 to y=290 and x=590 to x=710. Again, extending down the blue part for leverage. A reasonable bounding box for the right hand would be approximately [150, 580, 500, 710].6. **Refine bounding boxes:** Let's adjust these to be more precise and cover the intended grasp areas.    * **Hand 1 (Left):** The black grip is clearly visible and provides a good handhold. The blue part below it also offers a good leverage point. A box covering the majority of the left handle, focusing on the grip and lower part, would be [70, 350, 510, 485].    * **Hand 2 (Right):** The right handle has a similar grip. The blue part below is also visible. A box covering the majority of the right handle, focusing on the grip and lower part, would be [150, 585, 510, 715].Let's re-examine the image to ensure the best leverage. The handles are widest at the bottom.* Left handle: The black grip is roughly [70, 365, 215, 465]. The blue part below extends further. A good grasp for leverage would be lower down. So, let's focus on the lower portion for maximum leverage: [100, 350, 510, 480].* Right handle: The black grip is roughly [150, 595, 295, 705]. The blue part below extends further. For maximum leverage: [150, 585, 510, 715].Considering the need for a firm grip for cutting, the area around the rubber grips and extending down the handle is ideal for leverage.*   **Left Hand:** Grasping the lower part of the left handle. The black grip is from `y=70` to `y=210` and `x=365` to `x=465`. The blue handle extends further down. To maximize leverage, we want to grip as far down as possible. A good bounding box would cover the lower, wider part of the handle for maximum leverage. Let's select a range like `[100, 350, 510, 480]`.*   **Right Hand:** Grasping the lower part of the right handle. The black grip is from `y=150` to `y=295` and `x=595` to `x=705`. Similar to the left, we want to grip the lower, wider part for maximum leverage. Let's select a range like `[150, 585, 510, 715]`.Let's refine this slightly to ensure a firm grip that allows for powerful leverage.Left hand: The lower end of the left handle, focusing on the thicker part for better grip and leverage. `[100, 340, 510, 485]`Right hand: The lower end of the right handle, focusing on the thicker part for better grip and leverage. `[150, 580, 510, 720]`Upon closer inspection, the widest part of the handles, which are ideal for leverage, are the lower portions, including the black grips.Left handle: The black grip is roughly `[70, 365, 215, 465]`. The blue handle extends below this. For maximum leverage, the grip should be as far down as possible. So, let's capture the lower part of the handle. `[70, 350, 510, 480]`Right handle: The black grip is roughly `[150, 595, 295, 705]`. The blue handle extends below this. For maximum leverage, the grip should be as far down as possible. So, let's capture the lower part of the handle. `[150, 585, 510, 715]`Final check: These bounding boxes cover the length of the handles, ensuring a grip that allows for significant leverage.```json{""hand1"": [70, 350, 510, 480], ""hand2"": [150, 585, 510, 715]}```";{'hand1': [0.585, 0.15, 0.715, 0.51], 'hand2': [0.35, 0.07, 0.48, 0.51]};{'hand1': {'x_1': 0.599, 'y_1': 0.088, 'x_2': 0.74, 'y_2': 0.314}, 'hand2': {'x_1': 0.361, 'y_1': 0.073, 'x_2': 0.4715, 'y_2': 0.2815}};{'hand1': 0.3189698534589718, 'hand2': 0.4027840909090908};440;1444

To use the screwdriver, the robotic hand should grip the handle, which is the part designed for holding and turning. The handle is at the bottom of the screwdriver in the image.

The handle appears to be roughly between 500 and 950 in the y-axis and between 400 and 570 in the x-axis.

The goal is to identify the region where a robotic hand would wrap around this handle to open the door. The handle is located on the right side of the black door. The most effective way to grasp a horizontal lever handle is by placing the hand around the lever itself. Observing the image, the handle is centrally located on the door. A natural grasping motion would involve the palm and fingers encompassing the lever. Therefore, the bounding box should encompass the lever handle. {hand : [433, 603, 487, 630]};{'hand': [0.603, 0.433, 0.63, 0.487]};{'handle': {'x_1': 0.564, 'y_1': 0.587, 'x_2': 0.6155, 'y_2': 0.6005}};{'hand': 0.0};446;128

I need to identify the most suitable bounding box for my robotic hand to wrap around the handle for effective operation. 1. **Identify the target:** The target is the horizontal lever door handle, which is located on the wooden door. 2. **Analyze the handle's position and orientation:** The handle is mounted horizontally on the door. It has a lever part that needs to be pushed down. 3. **Determine the grasping strategy:** A typical grasping strategy for a horizontal lever handle would involve placing the hand around the lever to apply downward pressure. This means the hand needs to cover a significant portion of the lever's length and width. 4. **Locate the handle in the image:** The handle is clearly visible on the main wooden door in the center-right of the image. It's a silver-colored lever with a green element on its base. 5. **Define the bounding box:** * The lever extends horizontally. My hand should encompass its length. * The lever has a thickness, and my hand will wrap around it, so the box needs to include some height. * Looking at the image, the lever is approximately between y-coordinates 430 and 520 (normalized to 1000). * In the x-dimension, it spans from approximately 210 to 330 (normalized to 1000). * A good bounding box would cover the entire visible lever to ensure a secure grip. * Considering the shape and functionality, the bounding box should be centered on the lever. Let's refine the coordinates: The vertical extent of the lever is from roughly y=438 to y=520. The horizontal extent of the lever is from roughly x=208 to x=328. Therefore, a suitable bounding box would encompass this area. y_min: 438 x_min: 208 y_max: 520 x_max: 328 ```json {hand : [438, 208, 520, 328]} ```;{'hand': [0.208, 0.438, 0.328, 0.52]};{'handle': {'x_1': 0.218, 'y_1': 0.465, 'x_2': 0.319, 'y_2': 0.4785}};{'hand': 0.13856707317073125};446;485

I need to find the trigger of the glue gun and determine where my fingertip would best press it. The trigger is the orange part of the glue gun. The optimal placement for a fingertip to press the trigger would be on the front surface of the trigger, where it is designed to be pressed. Looking at the image, the trigger is an orange lever. The front surface of the trigger is the part that moves inward when pressed. I will identify a bounding box that covers the front surface of this orange trigger. Coordinates: The orange trigger is located roughly in the middle-left of the glue gun. The trigger's front surface is a curved area that faces the nozzle. I estimate the bounding box for the front surface of the trigger to be around: y_min: 340 x_min: 340 y_max: 400 x_max: 420 Let's refine these coordinates based on the image. The orange part starts around y=320 and ends around y=430. The trigger itself is angled. The front or pressing surface is the part that extends forward. Looking closely at the orange trigger, the area that would be pressed by a finger is the part that pivots. This appears to be the upper part of the orange lever. The trigger is roughly from x=330 to x=430. The trigger spans vertically from about y=320 to y=430. The part of the trigger that would be pressed by an index finger is the front-most surface of the orange lever. I will focus on the curved surface that is positioned to be pushed. This seems to be the upper portion of the orange lever. Let's try to pinpoint the center of the pressing area. The orange trigger is angled. The front surface is the upper part of this lever. y_min: 330 x_min: 345 y_max: 390 x_max: 415 Considering the shape and the typical way to press a trigger, the optimal placement would be on the upper, forward-facing surface of the orange trigger. Refined coordinates based on the image: The orange trigger is located around the center-left of the glue gun. Its front, pressable surface is the curved part of the lever. The approximate bounding box for this surface is: y_min: 335 x_min: 345 y_max: 395 x_max: 415 Let's check the cropped images to get a better view. The first crop clearly shows the trigger. The pressing surface is the curved part of the orange lever. The coordinates seem reasonable. Final estimation for the bounding box of the front surface of the trigger: y_min: 335 x_min: 345 y_max: 395 x_max: 415 {index: [335, 345, 395, 415]} Let me adjust slightly to make it more centered on the pressing surface. y_min: 340 x_min: 350 y_max: 390 x_max: 410 This seems to capture the main pressing area of the trigger. {index: [340, 350, 390, 410]} The final answer is: ```json {index: [340, 350, 390, 410]} ```;{'index': [0.345, 0.335, 0.415, 0.395]};{'index': {'x_1': 0.333, 'y_1': 0.284, 'x_2': 0.424, 'y_2': 0.303}};{'index': 0.0};457;823
7;grasp_vlm_dataset/screwdriver_8_jpg.rf.9622b33838c1779b9b429ba196bae0d9.jpg;The user wants me to identify the best region on the screwdriver for a robotic hand to grip. The goal is to fasten a screw, so the grip should allow for effective turning. The screwdriver has a handle designed for grip, with a textured rubberized part and a red accent. 1. **Analyze the screwdriver:** The screwdriver has a metallic shaft and tip, and a composite handle. The handle is the part designed for manual operation. 2. **Identify the grip area:** The most suitable area for a hand to grip and apply torque is the handle. The handle's shape and material are optimized for this purpose. 3. **Consider optimal grip:** The rubberized part of the handle, particularly the section with the Milwaukee logo, offers the best grip due to its texture and material. This area provides both comfort and friction for turning. 4. **Determine bounding box:** I need to define a bounding box around this grip area. The handle is towards the bottom of the image, and its entirety is a good candidate for gripping. The handle is predominantly black and red, and it's the widest part of the tool, ideal for gripping. The bounding box should encompass the entire gripable portion of the handle. Bounding box coordinates: - The handle starts around y=450 and extends to y=910. - It spans from x=240 to x=480. Therefore, the bounding box for the hand to grip the screwdriver would be approximately [450, 240, 910, 480]. ```json {hand: [450, 240, 910, 480]} ```;{'hand': [0.24, 0.45, 0.48, 0.91]};{'handle': {'x_1': 0.251, 'y_1': 0.422, 'x_2': 0.479, 'y_2': 0.9245}};{'hand': 0.8733449912565577};426;364

I need to provide a bounding box for the hand's grip. The handle is horizontal and located on the top drawer. I should aim for a grip that allows for easy and secure pulling of the drawer. A good grip would be around the center of the handle, allowing for a firm grasp. 1. **Identify the target:** The target is the handle of the top drawer. 2. **Analyze the handle:** The handle is a horizontal bar with decorative ends. 3. **Determine the best grip:** A natural and effective grip would be to wrap the hand around the bar, likely near the center for balance and leverage. 4. **Select the bounding box:** I'll choose a bounding box that encompasses a significant portion of the handle, specifically where a hand would naturally grasp it to pull. Looking at the image, the middle section of the handle is the most suitable for gripping. I will focus on the horizontal bar part of the handle, avoiding the decorative ends as much as possible to ensure a secure grip. The top drawer handle is clearly visible in the image. I will select a bounding box that covers the central part of this handle. The handle is located approximately between y=158 and y=213, and x=326 and x=668. A good grip would be around the middle of this range. I'll choose a bounding box that covers a substantial portion of the horizontal bar, emphasizing the middle for a firm grip. y_min: Roughly the top edge of the bar, around 165. x_min: The left side of the bar where a hand would start gripping, around 340. y_max: The bottom edge of the bar, around 205. x_max: The right side of the bar where a hand would finish gripping, around 650. Let's refine these coordinates to be more precise. The handle is a horizontal bar. I want to grab the bar itself. Looking at the middle handle: Top edge of the bar: ~170 Bottom edge of the bar: ~200 Left edge of the bar: ~330 Right edge of the bar: ~670 So a good grip would be centered on this. Let's try a bounding box that covers the central part of the bar: y_min: 170 x_min: 350 y_max: 200 x_max: 650 This covers the main part of the horizontal bar, which is ideal for gripping. Final check: The bounding box should be [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]. y_min = 170 x_min = 350 y_max = 200 x_max = 650 The coordinates seem reasonable for gripping the handle of the top drawer.```json {hand : [166, 337, 209, 671]} ```;{'hand': [0.337, 0.166, 0.671, 0.209]};{'handle': {'x_1': 0.326, 'y_1': 0.162, 'x_2': 0.678, 'y_2': 0.2155}};{'hand': 0.7626380628717074};457;674
9;grasp_vlm_dataset/saw_4_jpg.rf.45ee2fc78686e7837efd44b55fdcb7b6.jpg;The user wants me to identify the best placement for the pad of my robotic index finger to grasp a circular saw. I need to provide the bounding box in normalized coordinates. Here's my thinking process: 1. **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the optimal grip point for an index finger on the circular saw, assuming the saw is ready for immediate use. This implies a secure and functional grip. 2. **Analyze the Image:** The image shows a compact circular saw. Key features relevant to gripping are the handle and the trigger mechanism. * The main handle is ergonomically shaped and designed for hand grip. * There is a prominent trigger button on the top of the handle. * There are textured surfaces on the handle for better grip. * The saw has a protective shroud around the blade and a base plate. 3. **Identify the Best Grip Location:** For an index finger to operate the trigger and provide stability, the most natural and effective position would be on the handle, positioned to comfortably reach and depress the trigger. * The area just behind the trigger, on the textured grip of the handle, seems ideal. This allows the finger to be close enough to actuate the trigger while providing a secure purchase on the tool. * I need to avoid areas that would obstruct the trigger, prevent a firm grip, or put the finger in danger of contacting moving parts (like the blade or its guard). 4. **Determine the Finger Pad Area:** The request specifies the pad of your robotic index finger. This is the fleshy part of the fingertip, not the entire finger. The pad is responsible for tactile feedback and applying pressure. 5. **Locate the Target Area in the Image:** Looking at the image, the curved, textured surface of the handle, directly behind and slightly below the trigger, is the prime spot. This is where a human index finger would typically rest to operate the saw. 6. **Estimate Bounding Box Coordinates:** * I need to find a rectangular region that encompasses the optimal contact point for the fingertip pad. * The trigger is orange and located on the top of the handle. * The handle has a teal and black color scheme with textured patterns. * The best grip area is on the teal/black textured part of the handle, just behind the trigger. Let's examine the provided crops for closer detail. Crop 4 shows the handle and trigger clearly. The area directly behind the trigger seems most appropriate. * **Vertical (y-axis):** The area starts a bit below the top of the handle and extends downwards to where the handle begins to curve more significantly. Roughly, it's in the middle-to-lower part of the handle's visible height in this view. * **Horizontal (x-axis):** The area is centered on the handle, slightly behind the trigger. Considering the original image and the crops: * The trigger is roughly centered horizontally. The ideal grip point for the index finger pad would be directly behind the trigger's resting position. * Vertically, it would be on the main body of the handle where the grip is designed. Let's refine the bounding box based on visual estimation: * The handle section behind the trigger starts around y=420-430 and goes down to about y=530-550. * Horizontally, the trigger is around x=450-500. The grip area directly behind it would be around x=460 to x=520. Let me adjust this to focus on a specific point for the *pad* of the finger. A good contact point would be on the textured surface just behind the trigger. Re-evaluating based on the image: * The trigger is located around y=430-470 and x=460-490. * The ideal grip area for the finger pad would be just behind this, on the contoured handle. * A good spot for the *pad* would be around y=450-500 and x=480-530. Let's try to pinpoint a single optimal contact region for the fingertip pad. The textured area on the handle, directly behind the trigger, looks like the most suitable place. Estimating the coordinates: The trigger is roughly from `[431, 464, 473, 489]`. The ideal grip area for the finger pad would be just behind this. A good point for the pad would be around `y=475` and `x=505`. Let's define a small bounding box around this optimal point for the finger pad. `y_min` around 450, `y_max` around 520. `x_min` around 470, `x_max` around 540. Let me try to be more precise with the center of the grip. The trigger is the main interaction point for the index finger. The pad should be placed to comfortably reach and operate the trigger, while providing a solid grip. The textured area on the handle, just to the right and slightly behind the trigger's position in the image, seems optimal. Focusing on the textured grip area: The teal grip area starts around `y=425` and `x=420` and extends to the right. The trigger is around `y=431` to `473` and `x=464` to `489`. A good grip point for the finger pad would be on the textured part of the handle, centered roughly behind and to the right of the trigger. Let's try bounding box: `[450, 480, 520, 540]`. This covers a decent area on the textured grip behind the trigger. The exact point for the *pad* would be more specific. Let's try to center it on the most ergonomic part of the handle, allowing trigger access. Looking closely at the textured area behind the trigger, a good spot for the fingertip pad would be around y=475, x=505. A bounding box for this pad could be: `y_min = 455`, `y_max = 495`, `x_min = 485`, `x_max = 525`. Let's double check the location. The finger needs to operate the trigger, so its position should facilitate that. The rounded, textured part of the handle directly behind the trigger is the place. My final estimated bounding box for the fingertip pad's contact region: `y_min`: The upper edge of the pad would be around the middle height of the trigger. `y_max`: The lower edge of the pad would be on the main body of the handle. `x_min`: The left edge would be slightly to the right of the trigger's left edge. `x_max`: The right edge would be on the main grip area. Let's refine: The trigger is roughly `[431, 464, 473, 489]`. A good grip area for the index finger pad would be centered around `y=470` and `x=505`. A small bounding box for this pad area: `y_min = 450` `y_max = 490` `x_min = 480` `x_max = 530` This seems like a reasonable location for the finger pad to grip the handle and operate the trigger.```json {index: [455, 477, 505, 530]} ```;{'index': [0.477, 0.455, 0.53, 0.505]};{'index': {'x_1': 0.426, 'y_1': 0.5, 'x_2': 0.4575, 'y_2': 0.5785}};{'index': 0.0};451;1760

To effectively dig, the robot's hands should grip the handle at points that provide good leverage and control. The ideal placement for the left hand (hand1) would be on the upper part of the handle, closer to the shaft, to push and control the shovel's movement. The right hand (hand2) would be placed on the T-shaped part of the handle, providing a stable base and allowing for pulling and lifting.Therefore, hand1 should be placed on the thicker, lower part of the handle, near the T-grip, to maximize leverage and stability during digging. Hand2 should be placed further up the shaft, closer to the shovel head, to provide control and drive the shovel into the ground.Let's identify the bounding boxes:Hand 1 (Left hand): Located on the T-shaped grip at the bottom of the handle. It should encompass a good portion of this grip for stability. A suitable bounding box is [701, 58, 956, 146].Hand 2 (Right hand): Located on the shaft of the shovel, above the T-grip and below the metal head. This hand will provide leverage and drive. A suitable bounding box is [379, 392, 660, 499].{""hand1"" : [701, 58, 956, 146], ""hand2"" : [379, 392, 660, 499]}";{'hand1': [0.392, 0.379, 0.499, 0.66], 'hand2': [0.058, 0.701, 0.146, 0.956]};{'hand1': {'x_1': 0.122, 'y_1': 0.391, 'x_2': 0.6165, 'y_2': 0.894}, 'hand2': {'x_1': 0.06, 'y_1': 0.838, 'x_2': 0.181, 'y_2': 0.9585}};{'hand1': 0.11512394132410729, 'hand2': 0.37763512884919515};436;337
