The best placement appears to be on the black handle grip area, specifically near the center where the user would naturally place their index finger for control and balance. This spot provides:
- Optimal leverage
- Good control of the tool's movement
- Ergonomic positioning

After carefully examining the image, I'll provide the bounding box coordinates in the requested JSON format:

[0.48, 0.55, 0.52, 0.60]

These normalized coordinates represent a small region centered on the main handle grip, accounting for the proportions of the image.",,"[619, 389, 648.38, 400.88]",No predicted bbox found.
