The most ergonomic and stable placement appears to be on the right-side handlebar, specifically on the black rubber grip area near the throttle control. This location provides:
- Good leverage
- Natural hand positioning
- Close proximity to throttle control
- Stable support for operating the tool

Based on the image, the best placement appears to be on the front yellow portion of the drill, just above the black grip area, slightly to the right of the center line. This location provides:
- Good leverage
- Stable contact point
- Natural hand positioning
