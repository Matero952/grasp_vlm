The image shows a typical open-end wrench with two different-sized openings at each end. 2. For optimal grip and mechanical leverage when loosening a nut, I want to: - Maximize hand contact area - Ensure a secure, stable grip - Position near the end of the wrench for maximum torque 3. Key observations: - The longer side of the wrench provides more leverage - The handle/shaft offers a continuous, flat surface for gripping - Gripping too close to the open end reduces stability 4. Reasoning for grip location: - Avoid the open ends (they're narrow and less stable) - Choose the handle/shaft area - Aim for middle-to-lower third of the wrench length - Ensure a wide, stable contact area 5. Calculating normalized coordinates: - The wrench appears to be vertically oriented - I'll select a region spanning roughly the middle 40% of the wrench's length - Approximating: x1 = 0.3, y1 = 0.3, x2 = 0.7, y2 = 0.7 Here's the JSON: {hand: [0.3, 0.3, 0.7, 0.7]};{'hand': [0.3, 0.3, 0.7, 0.7]};{'handle': {'x_1': 0.551, 'y_1': 0.276, 'x_2': 0.629, 'y_2': 0.812}};{'hand': 0.18287536340617078};1508;298

This is a Crescent brand hammer with an ergonomic handle design 2. Key grip considerations: - Handle has black and red color sections - Handle has textured/non-slip surface - Optimal grip is typically around the lower 1/3 of the handle for best control and leverage 3. Analyzing grip location: - Want to grip where hand provides maximum stability - Avoid gripping near head/hammer end - Want center of mass close to hand 4. Precise coordinates: - Handle appears roughly 8-9 inches long - Optimal grip zone would be around 2.5-3 inches from bottom of handle - This provides balanced control and swing mechanics Calculating normalized coordinates: - Total image height looks to be about 1.0 - Handle height roughly 0.8 - Grip zone starts around 0.5 vertically - Horizontal center of handle is around 0.5 JSON output: {hand: [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7]} This provides a centered, stable grip zone covering the most ergonomic part of the hammer handle.;{'hand': [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7]};{'handle': {'x_1': 0.485, 'y_1': 0.474, 'x_2': 0.905, 'y_2': 0.551}};{'hand': 0.0882286573899963};1502;281

The door is black/dark colored with vertical panels 2. There are two prominent golden/brass-colored door hardware elements: - A vertical handle/knocker in the center - A round doorknob on the bottom right 3. The task specifies reaching the round doorknob, so I'll focus on that 4. To grasp the round doorknob, I'll need a bounding box that: - Covers the entire doorknob - Allows a grip that would enable rotation - Is normalized to the image dimensions 5. Estimating coordinates: - The doorknob appears to be roughly in the bottom-right quadrant - Approximate normalized coordinates: * x1 (left): 0.8 * y1 (top): 0.85 * x2 (right): 0.95 * y2 (bottom): 0.95 6.

Optimal Grasping Strategy: - Need a stable, centered grip that allows smooth opening - Should cover most of handle while avoiding drawer surface edges 3. Bounding Box Calculation: - Handle looks roughly circular, centered horizontally - Will create a box that encompasses the handle - Estimating handle diameter as ~15-20% of drawer width 4. Normalized Coordinates Reasoning: - Horizontally: Centered around 0.5 width - Vertically: Slightly above mid-height of drawer - Providing some margin around handle 5.
